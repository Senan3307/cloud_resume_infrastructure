# Purpose of the Infrastructure Repository in the Cloud Resume Challenge:
- Provisioning Cloud Resources:

The infrastructure repository is responsible for provisioning cloud services such as storage (e.g., S3), compute (e.g., Lambda or EC2), and databases (e.g., DynamoDB or RDS). It defines how these resources should be configured, connected, and scaled in the cloud environment.

- Automating Deployment:

It automates the deployment and scaling of the cloud application, ensuring that the infrastructure can handle changes in traffic and adapt as needed. Tools like AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) are often used to automate infrastructure provisioning.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

IaC practices allow the infrastructure to be versioned, maintained, and replicated easily. This enables consistent environments for development, staging, and production.

- Security and Access Control:

The repository ensures that security best practices are implemented by defining appropriate access controls, including IAM roles and permissions, ensuring the application and its resources are secure.

- Monitoring and Logging:

The infrastructure repository may define monitoring solutions using cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track the performance of the infrastructure and trigger alerts for errors or abnormal usage patterns.


In the Cloud Resume Challenge, the infrastructure repository is focused on managing and provisioning the resources needed to support the backend and frontend of the resume application using cloud services. This repository typically defines the cloud infrastructure, configuration, and automation scripts necessary to deploy and manage the entire application. It ensures that the application is scalable, secure, and reliable, leveraging Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools.

# Key Files and Directories in the Infrastructure Repository:

## main.tf
- main.tf will define cloud resources like S3 buckets, Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB tables

## .gitignore
- file tells Git which files or directories to ignore in a project
