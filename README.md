# Purpose of the Infrastructure Repository in the Cloud Resume Challenge:
- Provisioning Cloud Resources:

The infrastructure repository is responsible for provisioning cloud services such as storage (e.g., S3), compute (e.g., Lambda or EC2), and databases (e.g., DynamoDB or RDS). It defines how these resources should be configured, connected, and scaled in the cloud environment.

- Automating Deployment:

It automates the deployment and scaling of the cloud application, ensuring that the infrastructure can handle changes in traffic and adapt as needed. Tools like AWS CloudFormation, Terraform, or the AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) are often used to automate infrastructure provisioning.

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC):

IaC practices allow the infrastructure to be versioned, maintained, and replicated easily. This enables consistent environments for development, staging, and production.

- Security and Access Control:

The repository ensures that security best practices are implemented by defining appropriate access controls, including IAM roles and permissions, ensuring the application and its resources are secure.

- Monitoring and Logging:

The infrastructure repository may define monitoring solutions using cloud-native tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch) to track the performance of the infrastructure and trigger alerts for errors or abnormal usage patterns.
